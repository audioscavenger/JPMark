# Sample Exiv2 command file https://exiv2.org/sample.html
# -------------------------
#
# $ exiv2 -m cmd.txt file ...
#
# to apply the commands in cmd.txt to each file. Alternatively, commands can be 
# run from the command line directly, without a command file: 
#
# $ exiv2 -M"add Iptc.Application2.Credit String mee too!" file ...
# $ exiv2 -M"set Xmp.dc.subject LangAlt lang=en-US USA, AZ, Phoenix" file ...
#
# Note the quotes. Multiple -m and -M options are allowed and can be combined.
# 
# Command file format
# -------------------
# Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored
# Each remaining line is a command. The format for command lines is
# <cmd> <key> [[<type>] <value>] 
# cmd = set|add|del
#    set will set the value of an existing tag of the given key or add a tag
#    add will add a tag (unless the key is a non-repeatable IPTC key)
#    del will delete a tag 
# key = Exiv2 Exif or IPTC key
# type = 
#    Byte|Ascii|Short|Long|Rational|Undefined|SShort|SLong|SRational|Comment
#       for Exif keys, and
#    String|Date|Time|Short|Undefined  for IPTC keys
#    The format for IPTC Date values is YYYY-MM-DD (year, month, day) and
#    for IPTC Time values it is HH:MM:SS±HH:MM where HH:MM:SS refers to local 
#    hour, minute and seconds and ±HH:MM refers to hours and minutes ahead or 
#    behind Universal Coordinated Time.
#    A default type is used if none is explicitly given. The default type
#    is determined based on the key.
# value 
#    The remaining text on the line is the value. It can optionally be enclosed in 
#    double quotes ("value")
